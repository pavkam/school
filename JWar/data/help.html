<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">1. The Game. Some Notes.</span></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">The idea of the game is to destroy your opponents. At the start you have a single "<span style="font-style: italic;">Builder</span>" vehicle which<br>
you will place more conveniently near some resource fields and in an open spot. You will then build the<br>
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Main Building</span>" which will give you the possibility to build more units. Be sure to build more "<span style="font-style: italic;">Builders</span>"<br>
In the first stage of the game to be able to gather more resources faster. When you have a constant<br>
Resource supply you will probably want to create "<span style="font-style: italic;">Killers</span>" which are the war vehicles in this game.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">2. Game Types.</span><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are four different game types you can try out:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Normal</span>. You will enter a combat with another AI opponent.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Melee</span>. Defend yourself against 3 AI opponents J<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Free For All</span>. You and another 3 AI opponents will all fight each other.<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">2 vs. 2</span>. You will be teamed up with another AI to fight other 2 AI opponents.<br>

Selecting you own units will give</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">You the opportunity to give them orders and move them to any spot you like. Note that JWar is not</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Select-And-Point type of game like Starcraft &hellip; etc. You can give only high-level orders to your units.</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For example you can tell a &ldquo;Builder&rdquo; to enter &ldquo;Resource-Collection&rdquo; mode, which will make it seach for</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">nearest resources and so on. A &ldquo;Killer&rdquo; will also feature only a set of behavioral setups. Of course you can</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">aid your units by moving them to the position you like before giving them an order.<br>
<br>
Note that you can move a selected unit to another position by Right-Clicking on an empty cell on the map.<br>

the realms of JWar. But don't be fooled by it's innocence! It's a
nightmare! Each and one of these "beasts" will block your units
movement. That's why the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Killer</span>" vehicle will kill them on sight, just to clear the way for your "<span style="font-style: italic;">Builders</span>".</td>

These units have lots of hit points but are also dumb as cows are. You
will have to be careful to not let them in the hands of the enemy "<span style="font-style: italic;">Killers</span>" which will most surely try to destroy them at sight.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patrol</span>"</span> - engage "Patrol Near Home" mode which will make the "Killer" patrol near the home base at a predefined<br>
distance. A good mode when you're in a war and don't want to loose the main building.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3."<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protect</span>"</span> - engage "Protect Builders" mode. A unit having this mode will run to the farest Builder it can reach, then ... to <br>

threat and destroy it. Note that after destroying it's target, it will
not search for a new one.<br>
      <br>
In the modes 2 and 3, if "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killer</span>" will detect a near threat, it will suspend the mode it was in and try to destroy that target.<br>
After reaching it's goal, it will resume it's previous mode. Also note that if no mode is specified, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Killer</span>" will look around and if it finds a threat at a small distance it will automatically engage mode 4.</td>

Don't be fooled by the word "Main" in it's title, actually you can
build as many as you like. Actually, building more will give you and
advantage over your enemies. You can build more units in the same time
and you can also place those buildings near separate resource fileds
making resource collection faster as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Builders</span>" will select the nearest "<span style="font-style: italic;">Main Building</span>" when returning with the minerals.<br>
